Amidst the mountains of Luristan, the semi-nomadic Lurs crafted bronzes from 1500 BCE to 700 BCE. When a warrior and his horse died together, they were buried in the same grave with their weapons and equipment, including many bells of high copper content. Cast by the cire perdue (lost wax) method, such bells decorated collars and bridles. The clapper of this bell may have rusted away in damp soil, but it is known that most clappers were cast in iron for a livelier sound. Pitch: E5 and F5; Tone: sweet, short sustain.      + More information        Organization: Yale Collection of Musical Instruments     Photographer: Alex Contreras     Keywords: featured, bell, bells                  Animal bell   Maker unknown    I would like to:     request an image for download request an appointment                Name *    First    Last     Phone Number    ###  -   ###  -   ####     Email *        Requested Date (1st choice) *    MM  /   DD  /   YYYY      Requested Date (2nd choice)    MM  /   DD  /   YYYY      Instrument(s)        Accession Number        Purpose of Visit *         Number of People in Group               Do Not Fill This Out              ‹ June 2014 ›   Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa     25 26 27 28 29 30 31   1 2 3 4 5 6 7   8 9 10 11 12 13 14   15 16 17 18 19 20 21   22 23 24 25 26 27 28   29 30 1 2 3 4 5         ‹ 2014 ›      Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec          ‹ 2010-2019 ›      2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020            ‹ June 2014 ›   Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa     25 26 27 28 29 30 31   1 2 3 4 5 6 7   8 9 10 11 12 13 14   15 16 17 18 19 20 21   22 23 24 25 26 27 28   29 30 1 2 3 4 5         ‹ 2014 ›      Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec          ‹ 2010-2019 ›      2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020                  Name *    First    Last     Organization    Maximum Allowed: 100 characters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently Used: 0 characters.
