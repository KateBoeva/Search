According to President Salovey, “these lectures provide the Yale community with opportunities to celebrate the rich heritage embodied in the half-century since women first enrolled in Yale College and the more than 150 years of women’s academic affiliation in Yale’s graduate and professional schools.” They will continue through 2019 with a grand capstone celebration.
