Gehry’s 90th birthday on Feb. 28. This is the largest gift toward financial aid in the school’s history. Gehry has regularly taught at the Yale School of Architecture as a visiting faculty member since 1979, most recently teaching an advanced design studio on architectural aspects of criminal justice reform in the fall 2017 semester.  “My own involvement with Yale convinced me that this was a very special place,” says Gehry. “When interns or others who had worked in our office for a period of time were looking for a place to do their graduate studies, we always recommended Yale. In many cases the students could not go there because of lack of funds to meet the tuition needs.” The gift was made by Richard D. Cohen, philanthropist and founder of the real estate company Capital Properties. The Gehry Scholarships will be awarded annually to three entering master’s students for support throughout their graduate studies at the Yale School of Architecture as well as for the opportunity to travel to Los Angeles to see the workings of Gehry’s architecture firm.  “With the Gehry Scholarships students will have the opportunity to attend Yale regardless of background, and will also have more freedom after graduation to pursue their work in the way best suited to their talents, without the burden of significant debt,” says Deborah Berke, dean of the Yale School of Architecture. “Gehry Scholars will be able to focus on design and can start making an immediate difference in the architecture profession by forging their own paths.” On why it was important for the Gehry Scholarships to be at Yale, Gehry says: “I have great respect for the Yale School of Architecture. I have enjoyed for many years teaching there, and all of the wonderful experiences that have occurred in my life while spending time there. So, being associated with the school through a scholarship fund is very special to me.”     Arts &amp; Humanities   Campus &amp; Community                  Media Contact Bess Connolly: elizabeth.connolly@yale.edu, 203-432-1324                          More News        Film director to talk about his documentary on Sammy Davis Jr.        Grammy-winning singer-songwriter discusses creative writing process        Yale People Ivy-to-NBA player Butch Graves ’84        Noted photographer Larry Fink to discuss his art          Show More Articles                                         Yale             Browse Archives     Contact YaleNews     For the Media     It’s Your Yale     Apply to Yale     Give to Yale          Managed by the Office of Public Affairs &amp; Communications        Copyright &copy; 2019 Yale University &middot; All rights reserved &middot;  Privacy policy &middot;  Accessibility at Yale            Facebook     Twitter     Instagram     RSS Feeds                       Yale on Instagram
