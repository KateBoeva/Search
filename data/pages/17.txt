There you will find cultural and scientific treasures, from Van Gogh’s “Night Café” to the Guttenberg Bible to historic musical instruments to fossils of the earliest dinosaurs that walked the earth. There, too, are works by leading innovators in art, architecture, moving image, and design.  First-hand encounters with Yale’s collections are an integral part of teaching and learning across the university and forge creative connections that inspire tomorrow’s leaders. People of all ages are invited to visit the collections, join an exhibition tour, take classes with artists and curators, and enjoy the many other public programs offered throughout the year.
