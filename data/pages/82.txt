As deputy provost for collections and scholarly communication, Gibbons is assigned to all of Yale’s galleries, museums, and other holdings, and is responsible for convening and fostering collaboration among these scholarly resources. This portfolio includes the Yale University Art Gallery, the Yale Center for British Art, the Peabody Museum of Natural History, and other campus collections, in addition to the university-wide library system and Yale University Press.
