As a result, the numbers listed for any one school may not fully represent the entire body of faculty who teach and work with students in that school. In the Schools of Music and Drama, adjunct professors provide the core of the schools&rsquo; regular faculty. As a result, the distinction among the categories of tenured/term/non-ladder is less relevant in those schools. In the School of Medicine, the tenured category also includes appointments made on a continuing basis without term. Faculty in the School of Public Health are considered part of the School of Medicine. Faculty in the School of Engineering and Applied Science are counted within the Faculty of Arts &amp; Sciences.
