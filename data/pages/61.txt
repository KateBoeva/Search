The trustees act as fiduciaries to ensure that the university’s academic and administrative leadership are guided by sound policies and practices, with adequate resources, to further Yale’s mission. The trustees are attentive to balancing the needs of today’s faculty, students, alumni, and staff with those of future generations. The board has seventeen regular members: the president of the university, who chairs the board, ten appointed successor trustees, and six elected alumni trustees. In addition, the governor and lieutenant governor of the State of Connecticut are board members ex officio. The board meets at least five times during the year, usually in New Haven.
