Can a politician play a song at his rallies—even if the songwriter objects? Can a professor scan an article and share it with her class? Can a social media user turn an internet image into a meme? During Fair Use Week (Feb. 25 – March 1, 2019), Yale University Library staff and other experts will shed light on issues like these with panels, presentations, and pop-up tables to explore and explain the “fair use” of copyrighted materials permitted under Section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976.  Learn about the four factors that help determine fair use. See the Fair Use Week schedule of events and visit the library’s Fair Use Week website.              Bass Library renovation will take place this summer; fall opening planned     The Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Library will undergo renovation this summer to expand study space for the university’s growing undergraduate population. A newly revised plan calls for an increase in seating from 365 to 449 spaces and a smaller, updated print collection more closely aligned with today’s undergraduate curriculum. “Through expanded study space, a renewed collection, and the move of two librarians to more visible, upper-level offices, we will make Bass a more effective gateway to all the resources of Yale University Library,” wrote Susan Gibbons, the Stephen F. Gates ’68 University Librarian and deputy provost for collections and scholarly communication, in a Feb. 7 email to the campus community.  Read more about the planned renovation.
