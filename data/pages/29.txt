Dedicated October 1993.                                 Welcome                In 2019-20, Yale will celebrate the 50th anniversary of coeducation in Yale College and the 150th anniversary of women students at the university. This campus-wide celebration will include a host of lectures, exhibitions, and performances throughout the academic year. The goals set forth for the year were developed by a Steering Committee of alumnae and faculty. Two major gatherings “bookend” the activities of this historic year: to kick off the anniversary year, on September 19-22, 2019, there will be a special reunion for the women in the classes of 1971, 1972, and 1973 who matriculated together—as transfer students or freshmen—in September 1969. The year will conclude in November of 2020 with a second major weekend gathering - a convocation for the alumnae of all of Yale’s graduate and professional schools as well as Yale College. In between these two signature events, there will be a wealth of anniversary programming from groups across the entire university and around the world. Every Yale school, museum, and numerous organizations have already developed exciting commemorative plans. A calendar with details about these programs is being developed. In the meantime, view a sampling of planned anniversary events. We hope that groups of alumnae will use some of these campus events to organize mini-reunions with friends throughout the year. In addition, events are being planned in a number of cities that will bring anniversary programming to a wide audience of alumnae.
